# Names from Prison Architect

The game Prison Architect by Introversion has prisoners with custom names submitted by users. Some are more "hard core" than others.

Despite there being ["authorised" and "unauthorised" lists](http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/developer/nameingame/listnameingame.html), unauthorized names do pop up in the game. Not sure what that's about.
